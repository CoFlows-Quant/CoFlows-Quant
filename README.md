# Overview

The repository is a copy (fork) of the repository CoFlows-Quant/CoFlows-Quant. The latter represents the source-code for building the CoFlows engine so it is not a development project using the CoFlows engine!

The purpose of this repository is to allow experimentation for setting up a proper CI/CD pipeline for producing images for containers for the exectuion of the CoFlow engine.
